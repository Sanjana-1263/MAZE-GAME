# MAZE-GAME
# Description
A Maze is given as NxN binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A person starts from source and has to reach the destination. The person can move in all four directions: UP ("U"), DOWN ("D"), LEFT ("L"), RIGHT ("R").

In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination.
